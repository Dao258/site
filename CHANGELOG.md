# 0.5.0

Fixed layering of modals, which were being displayed behing the toolbar since it was made sticky

Fixed position of modals when they triggered after users have scrolled down the page

# 0.4.3

**Fixed event tracking**

The previous udpate added some event tracking, but it wasn't going through to Google Analytics in a very readable way,
so that's been fixed

**Out of date browser message**

The application doesn't work in Internet Explorer. IE is a pain to support, so I decided I wouldn't. As there have been
people trying to use Bulk Pinner with IE11, I've now created a simple Browser Out Of Date message that will let users
know that they should update to a modern browser.

# 0.4.2

**Added more custom event tracking**

This will allow me to see how people use the application, so I can see which parts are useful and which aren't so useful

# 0.4.1

**Removed note about limited users**

Pinterest have finally approved the app, so the notice that only testers can use it is no longer required

# 0.4.0

## Features

**Sticky Action Toolbar**

When scrolling down, the action toolbar will now become sticky. This is to stop users having to scroll back to the top
of the page to click the Pin button, but also because the other actions could be useful as a user scrolls

## Improvement

**Pin Preview option drop down hidden**

When a pin is successfully create, the options drop down is no longer required, so it is now hidden

**Autofill all note/link fields**

Added a new shortcut key that will automatically populate the note and link fields for all Pin Preview with the value
of the note and link fields in the first Pin Preview.

**Various code refactoring**

**Made interface somewhat responsive**

If using the application on mobile, it should be a lot more usable now

# 0.3.0

## Features

**Use Image Filename**

As requested by a tester, you can now select to use the filename of the image being pinned in the note field. This is
available through a drop down options menu in the top right of each pin preview component

**Keyboard Shorts**

I have added some simple keyboard shortcuts to hopefully make things even easier! To view the available keyboard shortcuts,
type `?`.

## Bug fixes

**Application header in Firefox**

Firefox seems to have issues when setting the height of an element to 100%, with a max height set in viewport units.
I've fixed that now so it should display as nicely in Firefox as it does in other browsers

**Error Reporting**

I was getting error reports in Bugsnag, however it wasn't including any information of the actual error.
I've now update the call to the service so I can see more information about errors if/when they happen. This will make
them a lot easier to identify, replicate and fix.

# 0.2.1

Whilst the previous release just a few minutes ago removed the need for jQuery, I forgot to actually
remove the script tags that was downloading the library.

Took this opportunity to also minify the main JS file, so it's much, much smaller now

# 0.1.0

Beta release

The initial version of the application. Allows people to select images from their device, add a note and then select which Pinterest board they should be sent to.

Users can select individual boards for each image, or select a board for all images to be sent to.

Currently the application uses a pretty raw implementation of FileReader to load up images, which is not the best for
performance, but that will be updated in the near future
